## Using Palette Cleanser

### Building your palette

To build your document palette, you can:

- Find ðŸŽ¨ Palette Cleanser in the Sketch Plugins menu and select "Build Palette" ![Palette Cleanser in the Plugins menu](assets/palette-cleanser-menu.png)
- Press `â‡§âŒ˜P` (Shift-Command-P) on your keyboard

Either option will generate a new artboard called "ðŸŽ¨ Palette Cleanser" on the first page of your Sketch document (**please don't change the artboard name**). This artboard will show all the colors used in your current document, separated into 2 columns:

- **Layer Style Colors** are colors you've used from a defined [Layer Style](https://www.sketch.com/docs/styling/#layer-styles) in your document or a Sketch library. For each color, you'll see:
  - A swatch of the color
  - The Layer Style names where the color appears
  - The color's hex value and opacity
  - How many times the color is used in your document
- **Unique Colors**  are colors in your document that are *not* from a Layer Style. For each of these colors, you'll see:
  - A swatch of the color
  - The color's hex value and opacity
  - How many times the color is used in your document

### Updating your palette

Once you've built your palette, Palette Cleanser will automatically update the palette artboard when any color is changed, added, or removed from your document - no need to build again!

If your document colors get out of sync with Palette Cleanser, you can always run "Build Palette" again.

### Removing your palette

To remove the Palette Cleanser artboard, you can:
- Select "Remove Palette" from the ðŸŽ¨Palette Cleanser in the Plugins menu
- Press `âŒ¥âŒ˜P` (Option-Command-P) on your keyboard
